## 🎯 What is Theme Switcher

**Theme Switcher** is a minimal example app demonstrating how to implement:

- Light / Dark mode switching  
- Persisting theme preference (e.g. in `localStorage`)  
- Clean toggling logic using React hooks  
- Tailwind CSS theming and styling  

Use this as a template for integrating theme toggle in larger React projects.
